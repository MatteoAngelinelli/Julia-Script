# Julia-Script
In this repository I will store my Julia's script which I used  to analyze the data set obtained by cosmological simulations developed with ENZO code 

maps.jl: In this script (printed for Julia's version 0.6.4) I used PyPlot package and I develop some functions to make the maps of the projection along the line of sight of the fields obtained by cosmological simulations (e.g.: gas density, temperature, velocity, etc.). The function "Shock Finder" was developed by Dr. Franco Vazza and it is explain in a dedicated scientific paper.

plot.jl: In this script (printed for Julia's version 0.6.4) I used PyPlot package for plotting the results of post-processing analysis make on the data set produced and presented by Dr. Franco Vazza in his scientific paper 

prof.jl: In this script (printed for Julia's version 0.6.4) I develop some functions which are used to analyse the radial distribution of the fields that are generated in cosmological simulations which are made by ENZO code. In particular I analyze the gas density and temperature and I compute di thermal and non-thermal pressure. The function "Shock Finder" was developed by Dr. Franco Vazza and it is explain in a dedicated scientific paper.
